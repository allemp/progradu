\chapter{Introduction}
Modern physics classroom instruction attempts to improve learning by reducing the cognitive load, which is done by providing a clear organizational structure for the factual knowledge and linking new material to previously known ideas \parencite{wieman2005transforming}. The goal of physics instruction is to help students become experts capable of solving problems \parencite{fischer2014quality,wieman2005transforming}. While lecture based instruction is often not very effective for retaining new knowledge \parencite{wieman2005transforming}, the content structure and relationships between concepts presented by the teacher positively correlate with student learning gains when analysed with conceptual network analysis \parencite{fischer2014quality}. 

For a long time automatic speech recognition (ASR) was outperformed by human speech recognition (HSR), but with the recent developments in the deep learning approach the error rate of automatic speech recognition and human speech recognition is almost the same in certain tasks \parencite{spille2018comparing}. This however is language specific. Work on automatic speech recognition with conversational Finnish started in 2012 and word error rate of 27.1\% was achieved by 2017 \parencite{enarvi2018modeling}. 

In natural language processing the creation of treebanks such as Turku Dependency Treebank and FinnTreeBank in the past decade have allowed for development of natural language processing toolkits with adequate performance with Finnish language such as FinnPos \parencite{silfverberg2016finnpos} and TurkuNLP \parencite{kanerva2018turku}. Lemmatization in the new toolkits is of particular interest, because it is essential for real world tasks in inflective languages such as Finnish \parencite{kanerva2018turku}.

Manually transcribing and preprocessing lessons from audio data for analysis is a very laborious task. The aim of this study is to develop a pipeline for studying physics lesson content structures and relationships between physics concepts with conceptual network analysis using automatic speech recognition and natural language processing. This is done to provide a new tool for analysing physics instruction for research and teacher education purposes.
