  abstract = {Major progress is being recorded regularly on both the technology and exploitation of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spoken language systems. However, there are still technological barriers to flexible solutions and user satisfaction under some circumstances. This is related to several factors, such as the sensitivity to the environment (background noise), or the weak representation of grammatical and semantic knowledge. Current research is also emphasizing deficiencies in dealing with variation naturally present in speech. For instance, the lack of robustness to foreign accents precludes the use by specific populations. Also, some applications, like directory assistance, particularly stress the core recognition technology due to the very high active vocabulary (application perplexity). There are actually many factors affecting the speech realization: regional, sociolinguistic, or related to the environment or the speaker herself. These create a wide range of variations that may not be modeled correctly (speaker, gender, speaking rate, vocal effort, regional accent, speaking style, non-stationarity, etc.), especially when resources for system training are scarce. This paper outlines current advances related to these topics.},

  abstract = {Developing a sense of community among students is one of the three pillars of an overall reform effort to increase participation in physics, and the sciences more broadly, at Florida International University. The emergence of a research and learning community, embedded within a course reform effort, has contributed to increased recruitment and retention of physics majors. Finn and Rock [1] link the academic and social integration of students to increased rates of retention. We utilize social network analysis to quantify interactions in Florida International University's Physics Learning Center (PLC) that support the development of academic and social integration,. The tools of social network analysis allow us to visualize and quantify student interactions, and characterize the roles of students within a social network. After providing a brief introduction to social network analysis, we use sequential multiple regression modeling to evaluate factors which contribute to participation in the learning community. Results of the sequential multiple regression indicate that the PLC learning community is an equitable environment as we find that gender and ethnicity are not significant predictors of participation in the PLC. We find that providing students space for collaboration provides a vital element in the formation of supportive learning community.},

This paper shows preliminary results using ASR in Chilean and Finnish middle and high school to automatically provide teachers a visualization of the structure of concepts present in their discourse in science classrooms. These visualizations are conceptual networks that relate key concepts used by the teacher. This is an interesting tool that gives feedback to the teacher about his/her pedagogical practice in classes.

  abstract = {The broad use of computer-supported collaborative-learning (CSCL) environments (e.g., instant messenger–chats, forums, blogs in online communities, and massive open online courses) calls for automated tools to support tutors in the time-consuming process of analyzing collaborative conversations. In this article, the authors propose and validate the cohesion network analysis (CNA) model, housed within the ReaderBench platform. CNA, grounded in theories of cohesion, dialogism, and polyphony, is similar to social network analysis (SNA), but it also considers text content and discourse structure and, uniquely, uses automated cohesion indices to generate the underlying discourse representation. Thus, CNA enhances the power of SNA by explicitly considering semantic cohesion while modeling interactions between participants. The primary purpose of this article is to describe CNA analysis and to provide a proof of concept, by using ten chat conversations in which multiple participants debated the advantages of CSCL technologies. Each participant’s contributions were human-scored on the basis of their relevance in terms of covering the central concepts of the conversation. SNA metrics, applied to the CNA sociogram, were then used to assess the quality of each member’s degree of participation. The results revealed that the CNA indices were strongly correlated to the human evaluations of the conversations. Furthermore, a stepwise regression analysis indicated that the CNA indices collectively predicted 54\% of the variance in the human ratings of participation. The results provide promising support for the use of automated computational assessments of collaborative participation and of individuals’ degrees of active involvement in CSCL environments.},

  abstract = {As information is available in abundance for every topic on internet, condensing the important information in the form of summary would benefit a number of users. Hence, there is growing interest among the research community for developing new approaches to automatically summarize the text. Automatic text summarization system generates a summary, i.e. short length text that includes all the important information of the document. Since the advent of text summarization in 1950s, researchers have been trying to improve techniques for generating summaries so that machine generated summary matches with the human made summary. Summary can be generated through extractive as well as abstractive methods. Abstractive methods are highly complex as they need extensive natural language processing. Therefore, research community is focusing more on extractive summaries, trying to achieve more coherent and meaningful summaries. During a decade, several extractive approaches have been developed for automatic summary generation that implements a number of machine learning and optimization techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent text summarization extractive approaches developed in the last decade. Their needs are identified and their advantages and disadvantages are listed in a comparative manner. A few abstractive and multilingual text summarization approaches are also covered. Summary evaluation is another challenging issue in this research field. Therefore, intrinsic as well as extrinsic both the methods of summary evaluation are described in detail along with text summarization evaluation conferences and workshops. Furthermore, evaluation results of extractive summarization approaches are presented on some shared DUC datasets. Finally this paper concludes with the discussion of useful future directions that can help researchers to identify areas where further research is needed.},

High school students (N=34) were assigned randomly to read either probability (experimental group) or negative number bases (control group). The structure of the probability material was represented by a directed graph that produced an interpretable map of the content structure. Cognitive structures were examined using a word association technique. The experimental students learned and retained a significant portion of the probability structure but the control students did not. A comparison of word association, achievement, and attitude data indicated that the learning of structure developed somewhat independently from learning to solve problems.},

  abstract = {Unsupervised semantic segmentation in the time series domain is a much-studied problem due to its potential to detect unexpected regularities and regimes in poorly understood data. However, the current techniques have several shortcomings, which have limited the adoption of time series semantic segmentation beyond academic settings for three primary reasons. First, most methods require setting/learning many parameters and thus may have problems generalizing to novel situations. Second, most methods implicitly assume that all the data is segmentable, and have difficulty when that assumption is unwarranted. Finally, most research efforts have been confined to the batch case, but online segmentation is clearly more useful and actionable. To address these issues, we present an algorithm which is domain agnostic, has only one easily determined parameter, and can handle data streaming at a high rate. In this context, we test our algorithm on the largest and most diverse collection of time series datasets ever considered, and demonstrate our algorithm's superiority over current solutions. Furthermore, we are the first to show that semantic segmentation may be possible at superhuman performance levels.},

Solutions proposed in the literature include increasing the size of the vocabulary and segmenting words into morphs. However, in many cases, the methods have only been experimented with low-order n-gram models or compared to word-based models that do not have very large vocabularies. In this paper, we study the importance of using high-order variable-length n-gram models when the language models are trained over morphs instead of whole words. Language models trained on a very large vocabulary are compared with models based on different morph segmentations. Speech recognition experiments are carried out on two highly inflecting and agglutinative languages, Finnish and Estonian. The results suggest that high-order models can be essential in morph-based speech recognition, even when lattices are generated for two-pass recognition. The analysis of recognition errors reveal that the high-order morph language models improve especially the recognition of previously unseen words.},

Työn tavoite on esitellä tilanne kouluissa sellaisena kuin sen on nyt ja siten toivottavasti innostaa opettajia tarkkailemaan, pohtimaan ja muuntelemaan omaa puhettaan kokeellisia töitä ohjatessa.

Työn analyysiosuudessa tehtiin kvalitatiivinen sisällönanalyysi kahdeksalle videoidulle oppitunnille. Tuntien aiheita olivat sähköteho, sähköenergia ja sähkön hinta. Opettajan puheen sisältöä tutkittiin yhtäältä havaintojen ja käsinkosketeltavien asioiden ja toisaalta fysiikan abstraktien teorioiden ja mallien kannalta. Opettaja puhe luokiteltiin kuuluvaksi joko ideoiden piiriin I, esineiden ja havaintojen piiriin O tai sellaiseksi, että se luo yhteyksiä näiden kahden piirin välille I/O. Tämän lisäksi aineistosta analysoitiin luokkahuoneessa tapahtuvan toiminnan laatua, jotta opettajan puhetta voitaisiin tarkastella sen viitekehyksessä. Tätä analysoitiin kahdessa ulottuvuudessa: kokeellisen toiminnan vaiheen ja luokkahuoneessa tapahtuvan vuorovaikutuksen kannalta.

Tutkimuksen keskeisinä tuloksina saatiin, että suurin osa opettajan puheesta kokeellisen työskentelyn aikana kuuluu esineiden ja havaintojen piiriin O. Sellaista puhetta, joka olisi puhtaasti ideioiden piirissä, ei esiintynyt juuri laisinkaan. Sen sijaan I/O-tyypin puhetta esiintyi jonkin verran, mutta valitet- tavasti sen määrä vaihteli voimakkaasti eri opettajien välillä. Lisäksi havaittiin, että tällaista puhetta esiintyi lähes yksinomaan opettajakeskeisen opetuksen aikana, jolloin opettaja luennoi ja kyseli kysymyksiä, ja oppilaiden rooli oli lähinnä passiivinen. Mahdollisuuksia tuoda I/O-tyypin puhetta myös kokeellisen työskeltelyn käytännön osuudelle (joka tässä tutkimuksessa tarkoitti oppilastyötä useimmissa tapauksissa) havaittiin. Tämän tutkimuksen johtopäätös on, että opettajien tulisi kiinnittää enemmän huomiota puheeseensa kokeellisen työskentelyn aikana ja erityisesti vetää enemmän yhteyksiä kokeellisten havaintojen ja fysiikan konseptien, mallien ja teorioiden välille.},

Since the 1930s, when Homer Dudley of Bell Laboratories proposed a system model for speech analysis and synthesis [1, 2], the problem of automatic speech recognition has been approached progressively, from a simple machine that responds to a small set of sounds to a sophisticated system that responds to fluently spoken natural language and takes into account the varying statistics of the language in which the speech is produced. Based on major advances in statistical modeling of speech in the 1980s, automatic speech recognition systems today find widespread application in tasks that require a human-machine interface, such as automatic call processing in the telephone network and query-based information systems that do things like provide updated travel information, stock price quotations, weather reports, etc. In this article, we review some major highlights in the research and development of automatic speech recognition during the last few decades so as to provide a technological perspective and an appreciation of the fundamental progress that has been made in this important area of information and communication technology.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACTGood conceptual understanding of physics is based on understanding what the key concepts are and how they are related. This kind of understanding is especially important for physics teachers in planning how and in what order to introduce concepts in teaching; connections which tie concepts to each other give direction of progress—there is “flux of information” so that what was learned before provides the basis for learning new ideas. In this study, we discuss how such ordering of concepts can be made visible by using concept maps and how they can be used in analysing the students’ views and ideas about the inherent logic of the teaching plans. The approach discussed here is informed by the recent cognitively oriented ideas of knowledge organisation concentrating on simple knowledge organisation patterns and how they form the basis of more complex concept networks. The analysis of such concept networks is then very naturally based on the use of network theory on analysing the concept maps. The results show that even in well-connected maps, there can be abrupt changes in the information flux in the way knowledge is passed from the initial levels to the final levels. This suggests that handling the information content is very demanding and perhaps a very difficult skill for a pre-service teacher to master.},

Large amount of data is required, because models should estimate the probability for all possible word sequences. For Finnish, Estonian and the other fenno-ugric languages a special problem with the data is the huge amount of different word forms that are common in normal speech. The same problem exists also in other language technology applications such as machine translation, information retrieval, and in some extent also in other morphologically rich languages. In this paper we present methods and evaluations in four recent language modeling topics: selecting conversational data from the Internet, adapting models for foreign words, multi-domain and adapted neural network language modeling, and decoding with subword units. Our evaluations show that the same methods work in more than one language and that they scale down to smaller data resources.},

  abstract = {Teacher-led whole class discussions are essential when it comes to guiding students' construction of knowledge, and recent studies on teaching and learning emphasize the need for more student-centered teaching methods. In previous studies, the extent to which different types of communication take place in the classroom have been extensively reported by means of lists, tables, and charts, yet these studies have not included overviews of how talk develops and progresses over time. This study addresses this aspect by presenting how different communicative approaches constitute a specific, cumulative communication structure. Within this structure, the role and temporal considerations of a dialogic approach to teaching are examined within a teaching sequence on the topic of electrical power and energy. The case data were analyzed on multiple levels. First, teaching sequences were presented graphically to provide a broader picture of the communicational orientation of the overall lesson. Second, a detailed analysis of dialogic interactions was executed to understand the quality and role of these interactions on a broader communicational level. This multilevel analysis provides insights into the different purposes and quality of dialogic implementation in terms of the cumulative and meaningful learning of science. Implications for teaching and teacher education and educational research are also discussed. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 50: 912–939, 2013},

Here we present a metric and technique to quantitatively assess the extent to which self-organizing directed networks exhibit a flow hierarchy. Flow hierarchy is a commonly observed but theoretically overlooked form of hierarchy in networks. We show that the ecological, neurobiological, economic, and information processing networks are generally more hierarchical than their comparable random networks. We further discovered that hierarchy degree has increased over the course of the evolution of Linux kernels. Taken together, our results suggest that hierarchy is a central organizing feature of real-world evolving networks, and the measurement of hierarchy opens the way to understand the structural regimes and evolutionary patterns of self-organizing networks. Our measurement technique makes it possible to objectively compare hierarchies of different networks and of different evolutionary stages of a single network, and compare evolving patterns of different networks. It can be applied to various complex systems, which can be represented as directed networks. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Complexity, 2011},

Social network analysis is a method that likewise creates a visual representation of data; a network map typically represents people and the connections, or lack thereof, between these people regarding a particular issue. While the goals of these two methods differ, the underlying data structures are similar; a network of relationships between data elements. Social network analysis is explored here as a supplement to concept mapping. A secondary analysis of a concept map to define to leadership needs was conducted using social network analysis. The methods and the implications for supplementing the analysis of concept maps and debriefing results with stakeholders are discussed.},

Results of the latest PISA survey conducted in 2012 were published in December 2013. According to the results, Finland is one of the few countries where girls performed better in mathematics than boys. The purpose of this work is to refine the analysis of this observation by using education data mining techniques. More precisely, as part of standard PISA preprocessing phase certain scale indices are constructed based on information gathered from the background questionnaire of each participating student. The indices describe, e.g., students’ engagement, drive and self-beliefs, especially related to mathematics, the main assessment area in PISA 2012. However, around 30\% of the scale indices are missing so that a nonstructured sparsity pattern must be dealt with. We handle this using a special, robust clustering technique, which is then applied to Finnish subset of PISA data. Already direct interpretation of the created clusters reveals interesting patterns. Clusterwise analysis through relationship mining refines the confidence on our final conclusion that attitudes towards mathematics which are often gender-specific are the most important factors to explain the performance in mathematics.},

Pedagogical link‐making is concerned with the ways in which teachers and students make connections between ideas in the ongoing meaning‐making interactions of classroom teaching and learning. First of all we draw upon socio‐cultural perspectives to outline why we think that ‘link‐making’ is fundamental to science learning and consequently to science teaching and then we identify three main forms of pedagogical link‐making. The related research literature is then used to specify pedagogical link‐making approaches associated with each of the three main forms. Finally, the resultant framework of link‐making forms and approaches is applied in analysing a teaching sequence taken from a UK secondary school science classroom. Part of this analysis involves identifying specific pedagogical tools/strategies that might be employed in the classroom to support link‐making.},

  abstract = {This article makes the case that teaching to support the meaningful learning of science must involve both dialogic ('opening up') and authoritative ('closing down') approaches. Attention is drawn to the underlying teaching skills involved in such teaching and this is illustrated by reference to a sequence of lessons on forces with 10-11 year-olds (year 6). Teaching science involves introducing pupils to the ways of talking and thinking of the scientific community. Take the case, for example, of teaching a group of key stage 3 pupils (11-14 year-olds) about the basic working of electric circuits (including the concepts of current, energy and resistance). How do we move from a situation where the pupils understand little or nothing about these ideas to one where they are able to talk and think about them for themselves? The intervening teaching sequence is likely to include various different activities, such as pupil practical work, a teacher demonstration, maybe use of a computer simulation, and so on. Whatever the activities used, however, a central feature of the lesson sequence must be the interactions, or talk, between teacher and pupils. It is through this talk that the scientific story is introduced. This may seem obvious! How else can we teach science apart from interacting with pupils? However, these interactions are all too often ignored or taken for granted in a teaching sequence. Particular approaches to teaching electricity are spoken of in terms of this activity or that, but rarely in terms of the ways in which the classroom talk is developed over a sequence of lessons, employing a range of different approaches. This article attempts to redress the balance a little by offering a report from an ongoing research project (Mercer, et al., 2006) focusing on the different ways in which teachers frame classroom talk in introducing new scientific ideas to pupils. In particular, we argue that, in order for meaningful learning to result from a sequence of science teaching, teaching must involve both dialogic ('opening up') and authoritative ('closing down') communicative approaches. The argument builds upon these theoretical ideas (Mortimer and Scott, 2003) and is illustrated with empirical data from a sequence of lessons on forces with 10-11 year-olds (year 6). First, the idea of the communicative approach is introduced, before turning to the analysis and discussion of the forces lessons. The communicative approach},

The lemmatization is performed employing a combination of a rule-based morphological analyzer, OMorFi, and a data-driven lemmatization model. The toolkit is readily applicable for tagging and lemmatization of running text with models learned from the recently published Finnish Turku Dependency Treebank and FinnTreeBank. Empirical evaluation on these corpora shows that FinnPos performs favorably compared to reference systems in terms of tagging and lemmatization accuracy. In addition, we demonstrate that our system is highly competitive with regard to computational efficiency of learning new models and assigning analyses to novel sentences.},

  abstract = {Former comparisons of human speech recognition (HSR) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) have shown that humans outperform ASR systems in nearly all speech recognition tasks. However, recent progress in ASR has led to substantial improvements of recognition accuracy, and it is therefore unclear how large the task-dependent human-machine gap still remains. This paper investigates this gap between HSR and ASR based on deep neural networks (DNNs) in different acoustic conditions, with the aim of comparing differences and identifying processing strategies that should be considered in ASR. We find that DNN-based ASR reaches human performance for single-channel, small-vocabulary tasks in the presence of speech-shaped noise and in multi-talker babble noise, which is an important difference to previous human-machine comparisons: The speech reception threshold, i.e., the signal-to-noise ratio with 50\% word recognition rate is at about −7 to −8~dB both for HSR and ASR. However, in more complex spatial scenes with diffuse noise and moving talkers, the SRT gap amounts to approximately 12~dB. Based on cross comparisons that use oracle knowledge (e.g., the speakers’ true position), incorrect responses are attributed to localization errors or missing pitch information to distinguish between speakers with different gender. In terms of the SRT, localization errors and missing spectral information amount to 2.1 and 3.2~dB, respectively. The comparison hence identifies specific components in ASR that can profit from learning from auditory signal processing.},

These are complex networks in which links between students indicate assistance with homework. The courses included in the study are intermediate Classical Mechanics, introductory Quantum Mechanics, and intermediate Electromagnetism. By correlating these nodal centrality measures with students' scores on homework and exams, we find four centrality measures that correlate significantly with students' homework scores in all three courses: in-strength, out-strength, closeness centrality, and harmonic centrality. These correlations suggest that students who not only collaborate often, but also collaborate significantly with many different people tend to achieve higher grades. Centrality measures between simultaneous collaboration networks (analytical vs. numerical homework collaboration) composed of the same students also correlate with each other, suggesting that students' collaboration strategies remain relatively stable when presented with homework assignments targeting different skills. Additionally, we correlate centrality measures between collaboration networks from different courses and find that the four centrality measures with the strongest relationship to students' homework scores are also the most stable measures across networks involving different courses. Correlations of centrality measures with exam scores were generally smaller than the correlations with homework scores, though this finding varied across courses.},

They are useful for exploratory data mining and are often used as inputs for various time series clustering, classification, segmentation, rule discovery, and visualization algorithms. Since the introduction of the first motif discovery algorithm for univariate time series in 2002, multiple efforts have been made to generalize motifs to the multidimensional case. In this work, we show that these efforts, which typically attempt to find motifs on all dimensions, will not produce meaningful motifs except in the most contrived situations. We explain this finding and introduce mSTAMP, an algorithm that allows meaningful discovery of multidimensional motifs. Beyond producing objectively and subjectively meaningful results, our algorithm has a host of additional advantages, including being much faster, requiring fewer parameters and supporting streaming data. We demonstrate the utility of our mSTAMPbased motif discovery framework on domains as diverse as audio processing, industry, and sports analytics.},

  abstract = {The last decade has seen a flurry of research on all-pairs-similarity-search (or, self-join) for text, DNA, and a handful of other datatypes, and these systems have been applied to many diverse data mining problems. Surprisingly, however, little progress has been made on addressing this problem for time series subsequences. In this thesis, we have introduced a near universal time series data mining tool called matrix profile which solves the all-pairs-similarity-search problem and caches the output in an easy-to-access fashion. The proposed algorithm is not only parameter-free, exact and scalable, but also applicable for both single and multidimensional time series. By building time series data mining methods on top of matrix profile, many time series data mining tasks (e.g., motif discovery, discord discovery, shapelet discovery, semantic segmentation, and clustering) can be efficiently solved. Because the same matrix profile can be shared by a diverse set of time series data mining methods, matrix profile is versatile and computed-once-use-many-times data structure. We demonstrate the utility of matrix profile for many time series data mining problems, including motif discovery, discord discovery, weakly labeled time series classification, and representation learning on domains as diverse as seismology, entomology, music processing, bioinformatics, human activity monitoring, electrical power-demand monitoring, and medicine. We hope the matrix profile is not the end but the beginning of many more time series data mining projects.},
